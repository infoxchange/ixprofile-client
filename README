Functionality

* Logging in is managed by the profile server. Users are redirected to its
  login page for logging in.
* Users are identified by emails, they use their email to log in to the profile
  server.
* User details (e.g. names) are updated from the profile server.

  is_active flag subscribes and unsubscribes them from the application.
